**Ideas suggested by AI**

1.  **Medical Diagnostic assistant**
-   **Description:** A system that diagnoses a simple illness based on the users input to questions about what is ailing them.
-   **Rule-Based approach**:
    -   The system would ask the user a series of questions about their symptoms, and based on the yes, no answers.
    -   The AI would follow the tree rules to suggest a possible condition.
2.  **Text based adventure game**
-   **Description:** The player navigates a location and interacts with objects. The AI's role is to interpret commands and describe the outcome.
-   **Rule-Based Approach**
    -   It would use rules to understand the commands and progress the story and world state.
    -   The player would use text commands for each action like navigation, or a player action.
3.  **Customer service chatbot**
-   **Description:** A simple customer Service chat bot that would simulate normal conversation by using the inputs of the user and keywords contained within to respond with predefined answers.
-   **Rule-Based Approach:**
    -   The system would ask basic questions and use pattern matching to answer the question.
    -   As well as rules to simulate conversation to get the person the current answer of direct them to the correct dept.

**Chosen Idea: Medical Diagnostic Assistant**

**Justification:** The project that I have chosen to create is the medical diagnostic assistant. I believe it will provide a challenge as well as provide enough complexity to make it interesting and fun to create. Also, this will give me a chance to see a very small portion of how AI helps people and advances the response time in emergent situations.

**Rules/Logic for the Medical Diagnostic Assistant**

The Medical Diagnostic Assistant will follow these rules:

1.  Exact Match Rule:
-   If the user has a fever and body aches we diagnose the flu
2.  Partial Match Rule:
-   If the user does have a fever but does not have body aches could have the flu but need more information
3.  No match Rule:
-   If the user does not have a fever or body aches move to next question for more diagnostics.

**Rules/Logic for the Medical Diagnostic Assistant:**

sample inputs and outputs:

does the user enter yes to having a fever, and does the user answer yes to having body aches. Diagnosis "The Flu. Body aches and a fever are common symptoms of the flu."

Does the user enter no to having a fever but yes to is it worse indoors. Diagnosis "Allergies. Symptoms that worsen indoors can often be due to indoor allergens like dust mites or pet dander."

Does the user answer no to having a fever, and no to it being worse indoors, but answers yes for do they have a scratchy throat. Diagnosis "The Common Cold. A sore throat without a fever is a classic sign of a common cold."

**Reflection**

My rules based system works by asking the user questions in a logical order to determine whether the user has the flu, the common cold, allergies, or whether it could be another minor ailment. It does this by process of elimination. And the rules set in the program.

I really did not encounter any issues as I use AI in my daily life for debugging code in my job, so I have learned over time how to phrase the questions that I ask and how to be precise with the things that I request which makes working with it easier.
