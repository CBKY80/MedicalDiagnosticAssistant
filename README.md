# Ideas suggested by AI
1.	Medical Diagnostic assistant
    The system would ask the user a series of questions about their symptoms, and based on the yes, no answers. The AI would follow the tree rules to suggest a possible condition.
2.	Text based adventure game
    The player would use text commands for each action like navigation, or a player action. It would use rules to to understand the commands and progress the story and worlds state.
3.	Customer service chatbot
    The system would ask basic questions and use pattern matching as well as rules to simulate conversation to get the person the current answer of direct them to the correct dept.


The project that I have chosen to create is the medical diagnostic assistant. I believe it will provide a challenge as well as provide enough complexity to make it interesting and fun to create. Also, this will give me a chance to see a very small portion of how AI helps people and advances the response time in emergent situations.


# Reflection
My rules based system works by asking the user questions in a logical order to determine whether the user has the flu, the common cold, allergies, or whether it could be another minor ailment. It does this by process of elimination. And the rules set in the program.
I really did not encounter any issues as I use AI in my daily life for debugging code in my job, so I have learned over time how to phrase the questions that I ask and how to be precise with the things that I request which makes working with it easier.
